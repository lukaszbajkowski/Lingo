## General Information
- This project allows users to learn foreign languages through access to professional translations made by translators and also access to information about how to improve their language learning.
- The problem as Lingo is to solve is to simplify users' access to translators and also to give them knowledge on how they can develop their language skills. And all this in an accessible form.

## Project Status
Current status of the project: _in progress_



## Room for Improvement
At the moment, some image files need improvement. They do not all have the same extension. The extension of the project logo needs to be changed to a file with the extension .svg. In addition, the frames for the animations contained in the ScrollingSection need to be created in order to provide the right fluidity for them.

Room for improvement:
- Unification of image file extensions.
- Creating a keyframe for animation in ScrollingSection.

To do:
- Implementation of a payment system
- Creation of a panel for the user and for the translator.
- Creation of a blog section to publish information on how to learn languages effectively.
